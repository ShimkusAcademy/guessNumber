# Guess the Number Game - Lesson Plan

## Objective
The objective of this lesson is to introduce children aged 10 and under to basic programming concepts and logical thinking using a simple guessing game.

## Materials Needed
- Computer with Python installed
- Code editor or Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Projector or screen for group instruction (optional)

## Duration
Approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour

## Lesson Outline

### Introduction (5 minutes)
- Begin by engaging the students in a discussion about games they enjoy playing and introduce the concept of a guessing game.
- Explain that they will learn how to create a simple guessing game using Python, a programming language.

### Code Explanation (10 minutes)
1. Start by showing the code snippet provided in the README file. Explain each section briefly:
   - Importing the `random` module to generate random numbers.
   - Generating a random number and storing it in the variable `number_to_guess`.
   - Using a `while` loop to keep the game running.
   - Using a `try-except` block to handle input errors.
   - Comparing the user's guess with the random number and providing feedback.

### Hands-on Activity (25 minutes)
1. Divide the children into pairs or small groups, and provide each group with a computer.
2. Open a code editor or Python IDE on each computer.
3. Guide the children through the process of typing the code from the README, explaining each step as they go along.
4. Encourage them to experiment with the code, make changes, and see how it affects the game.
5. Assist the groups as needed and answer any questions they may have.

### Group Sharing and Discussion (10 minutes)
1. Invite each group to share their experience and any modifications they made to the game.
2. Discuss the importance of each part of the code, such as the `random` module, the `while` loop, and the `try-except` block.
3. Emphasize the logic behind the comparisons and how they determine whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Wrap-up and Reflection (5 minutes)
- Recap the key concepts learned during the lesson, such as using loops, handling errors, and basic conditional statements.
- Encourage the children to think about other games that could be created using similar programming techniques.

## Homework (Optional)
- Challenge the children to modify the game by adding features such as limiting the number of guesses, providing hints, or creating a multiplayer version.

## Assessment
- Monitor the children's engagement and participation during the hands-on activity.
- Evaluate their understanding based on their ability to explain the purpose of each code section and how they modified the game.

## Additional Resources
- Provide recommended online resources or tutorials for children to continue exploring programming concepts and coding games.

Note: Make sure to adapt the lesson plan based on the children's skill level and familiarity with programming concepts. Use simple language and interactive activities to keep them engaged and excited about learning to code.
